# LiDAR-Spoofing-Forensics-Datasets

Despite the controversy among autonomous vehicle (AV) companies in terms of whether to incorporate the expensive LiDAR sensors in the AV design, the majority of high-autonomy AVs nowadays are equipped with LiDARs. Due to the high-accuracy that LiDAR sensors provide, LiDAR data (represented as point clouds) is used in various tasks in the AD system, including obstacle detection and localization. For example, in LiDAR localization, the LiDARs point cloud will be matched in a pre-built point cloud map to find the best matching position. However, researchers recently found that
LiDAR is vulnerable to external laser interferences. which can be exploited by attackers to iniect new points or modify/remove existing points in the point cloud. 

Such attacks are named as LiDAR spoofing attacks and have been a serious threat to AD localization and detection accuracy.
